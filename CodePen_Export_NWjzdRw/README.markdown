My personal site. It is the first project in HTML, CCS and JavaScript. 
I use the concepts like:

= HTML Links - Hyperlinks
= Nested HTML Elements
= The href Attribute
= The src Attribute
= HTML Text Formatting
= HTML Tables


= CSS Background Color
= CSS Padding
= CSS Height and Width
= CSS Fonts
= CSS Tables


= JavaScript Functions
= JavaScript Loops
= JavaScript Iterables
= Conditional Statements
= When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.
= HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
