My personal site. It is the first project in HTML, CCS and JavaScript. 

I use the concepts like:


= HTML Links - Hyperlinks

= Nested HTML Elements

= The href Attribute

= The src Attribute

= HTML Text Formatting

= HTML Tables


= CSS Background Color

= CSS Padding

= CSS Height and Width

= CSS Fonts

= CSS Tables



= JavaScript Functions

= JavaScript Loops

= JavaScript Iterables

= Conditional Statements

= When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

= HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
