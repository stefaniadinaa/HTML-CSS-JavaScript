Projects worked on during the course: Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS

I learn how to:

1. Think critically about how to solve a problem using programming;

2. Write JavaScript programs using functions, for loops, and conditional statements;

3. Use HTML to construct a web page with paragraphs, divs, images, links, and lists;

4. Add styles to a web page with CSS IDs and classes; 

5. Make a web page interactive with JavaScript commands like alert, onClick, onChange, adding input features like an image canvas, button, and slider
